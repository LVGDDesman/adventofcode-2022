# Advent of Code in Bash

This repository tries to solve the Challenges provided by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in Bash and all tools provided a standard/my Linux system.
The focus is on coding as little as possible and not using as few arrays as possible.

To use the scripts, download the datafiles of a day into its associated folder and run both scripts:
```
./part1.sh <path-to-file>
./part2.sh <path-to-file>
```
